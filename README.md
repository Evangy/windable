# Wind-JS  

An in-progress fork of Esri's wind-js (MIT License).

# Overview

Windable is a configurable library for setting up wind visualizations on your maps.
It can work with any Canvas map layer (Google Maps, Leaflet).
Windable borrows heavily from the work of wind-js and earth.nullschool.

The source code is annotated (but not compiled) with ClosureJS style comments.
