# Windable Overview

Windable is a (in progress) configurable library for setting up wind visualizations on your maps.
It can work with any Canvas map layer (Google Maps, Leaflet).
Windable borrows heavily from the work of Esri's Wind-js and earth.nullschool.

The source code is annotated (but not compiled) with ClosureJS style comments.
